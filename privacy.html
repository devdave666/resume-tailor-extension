        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: June 15, 2025</strong></p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use the Resume Tailor Chrome Extension ("the Extension").</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Do Not Collect or Store</h2>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously. We have designed the Extension to minimize data collection. Specifically, <strong>we do not store your personal files on our servers.</strong> This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your resume</li>
            <li>Your LinkedIn profile</li>
            <li>Generated cover letters or tailored resumes</li>
            <li>Any other uploaded documents</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Processing</h2>
        <p>To provide its core functionality, the Extension needs to process certain data. This processing happens as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client-Side Processing:</strong> The job description is read directly from the active web page on your computer.</li>
            <li><strong>API Transmission:</strong> To tailor your resume and generate a cover letter, the text content of your resume, your LinkedIn profile (if provided), and the job description are sent securely to a third-party AI service (such as OpenAI) and a document parsing service (such as PDF.co). These services process the data to perform the requested task and return the result. We do not log the content sent to these APIs in our own systems. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The Extension requests the following permissions in your browser:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> To read the content of the current job posting page when you activate the extension.</li>
            <li><strong>scripting:</strong> To execute the script that extracts text from the active tab.</li>
            <li><strong>storage:</strong> To store your token balance and settings locally on your computer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
