 Resume Tailor & Cover Letter Generator - READMEThis Chrome extension empowers users to automatically tailor their resume and generate a custom cover letter for any job posting online. It features a token-based system for monetization and prioritizes user privacy by processing data through a secure backend.User FlowNavigate to Job Posting: The user finds a job they are interested in on any website.Open Extension: The user clicks the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.Automatic Extraction: The extension's popup opens and automatically extracts the text from the job description on the page.Upload Documents: The user uploads their resume (PDF, DOCX, or text) and optionally their LinkedIn profile.Check Tokens: The UI displays the user's current token balance. If the balance is zero, the "Generate" button is disabled, and a prompt to purchase more tokens appears.Generate: If the user has tokens, they click "Customize & Generate." A loading indicator appears.Backend Processing: The extension securely sends the files and job description text to a backend server. The backend:Uses a document parsing API (like PDF.co) to extract text from the files.Sends the extracted texts to an AI API (like OpenAI's GPT-4o) to generate the tailored resume and cover letter.Creates DOCX and PDF versions of the generated documents.Download: The UI updates to a "Success" view, showing download buttons for the tailored resume and cover letter in both DOCX and PDF formats. One token is deducted from the user's balance.Project Structure/

How to Set Up and Run LocallyDownload Files: Place all project files into a single local folder.Create Icons: Inside the project folder, create an icons subfolder and add icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png.Open Chrome Extensions: In Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions.Enable Developer Mode: Activate the "Developer mode" toggle.Load Extension: Click "Load unpacked" and select your project folder.Pin Extension: Pin the "Resume Tailor" extension to your toolbar for easy access.How to Implement the Backend and Integrate APIsThe extension is client-side only and uses placeholders. A secure backend is required for full functionality.Security First: Never embed secret API keys (e.g., OpenAI, PDF.co) in the client-side JavaScript. All API calls must be proxied through your own secure server.Step 1: Build Your Secure BackendChoose a backend technology (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask) and set up the following API endpoints. The server should be able to handle multipart/form-data for file uploads.POST /generate: This is the main endpoint.Receives resume (file), profile (optional file), and jobDescription (text).Parse Files: Send the resume and profile files to the PDF.co API to extract clean text.Generate Content: Construct a detailed prompt for the OpenAI GPT-4o API. Send the parsed resume text, profile text, and job description. Instruct the AI to return a JSON object containing the tailored resume and cover letter text.Create Documents: Use libraries like docx (for Node.js) or python-docx to create .docx files from the AI-generated text. Use another library like pdf-lib or wkhtmltopdf to convert the text/DOCX to .pdf files.Return Files: Respond to the client with the generated files. A good approach is to return a JSON object with temporary, secure download URLs for each of the four files (resume DOCX/PDF, cover letter DOCX/PDF).POST /create-payment-session:Integrates with Stripe or Paddle to create a checkout session for purchasing tokens.Returns a checkout URL to the client.POST /payment-webhook:A webhook endpoint that Stripe/Paddle will call upon a successful payment.Securely validates the webhook event and updates the user's token balance in your database.Step 2: Update popup.jsModify callBackendAPI(): Replace the placeholder logic with a fetch call to your POST /generate endpoint. It should send a FormData object containing the files and job description. It should then handle the response from your backend to get the download links for the generated documents.Modify purchaseTokensBtn listener: Replace the alert with a fetch call to your POST /create-payment-session endpoint and redirect the user to the returned checkout URL.Publishing to the Chrome Web StoreCreate a Developer Account: Register on the Chrome Web Store developer dashboard (one-time $5 fee).Package Extension: Create a .zip file of your entire project folder.Upload & Describe: Upload the zip file to the dashboard. Write a clear description, provide screenshots, and add a link to your privacy policy.Justify Permissions: You must clearly explain why your extension requires the activeTab, scripting, and storage permissions.Submit for Review: Submit your extension. The review process checks for policy compliance, security, and functionality. Be prepared for it to take several days.
