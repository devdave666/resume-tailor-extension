        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: June 15, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Resume Tailor Chrome Extension ("the Extension").</p>
        
        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By using the Extension, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
        <p>The Extension uses AI to help you tailor your resume and generate cover letters. This service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information generated, and you agree that the use of any generated content is at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>3. Token System</h2>
        <p>The use of the generation feature requires tokens. Tokens can be purchased through our designated payment provider (e.g., Stripe, Paddle). All purchases are final and non-refundable. One token is deducted for each successful generation of a resume and cover letter set.</p>
        
        <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for the final content of your application materials. You should carefully review and edit all generated text to ensure it is accurate and represents you appropriately before submitting it to a potential employer.</p>
